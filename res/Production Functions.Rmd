## Selection of a Production Function

The identification of a production function is a relevant policy question given the increasing import of achieving constitutional standards.

## Simple Cobb-Douglas

A simple Cobb-Douglas can be given

$Y(L,K) = L^\alpha K^\beta$

Here we solve for, given $i$ is time and trust is $j$ - Conceptually what we are saying is tha

$Y_{ij} = L_{ij}^\alpha K_{ij}^\beta +(1|j)$

Consider, for example, a situation where

```         
```

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
